    p The UBports project is fairly new and it might need a kick to really get started, the UBport team is working hard to make this project a huge success!
    p It is very easy to make a difference. Depending on your skill set, your availability, and on your wealth you can help UBports in one or more of the following ways:
    h2 Financial help
    hr(style="border-top-color: white; margin-top: 4px")
    h3 Donations
    p You can help by making a financial contribution to the project. What we need to make this project a success is debug devices, OTA servers, web servers, CI servers and other things that cost money. We already have some servers donated by DigitalOcean.
